# Learning Classifiers for Point Clouds

- **Spring 2018 WUSTL CSE Independent Study**
- **Advisor: Prof. Ayan Chakrabarti**

This independent study deals with the topic of point clouds. Processing point clouds is an important task since many 3D sensors produce point clouds as outputs. During this study, I learned and explored effective techniques to analyze point clouds and acquire information from them. Starting from studying current literature, I implemented several neural networks, understood the mechanism behind them, and improved the performance by changing architectures. In the report, I first summarized the main papers I read, and then presented and analyzed the experiments I ran.
